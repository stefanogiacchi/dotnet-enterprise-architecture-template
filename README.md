# **.NET Enterprise Architecture Template (AI-Ready)**

### *A modern cloud-native, enterprise-grade, AI-first architecture template for real-world systems.*

---

##   Overview

This project is a **modern, enterprise-grade template** for building scalable, modular, cloud-native, AI-ready applications using **.NET 8**, leveraging:

* Clean Architecture principles
* C4 modelling
* CQRS + Vertical Slices
* AI Integration Layer (Azure OpenAI, Cognitive Search, Vector Stores)
* ADR (Architecture Decision Records)
* Cloud-Ready Infrastructure (Container + DevOps)
* Documentation-as-code (Wiki-ready for GitHub & Azure DevOps)

It is designed as a **practical accelerator** for teams and architects working on:

* Enterprise systems
* Public Sector solutions
* Regulated environments (finance, healthcare, energy)
* Cloud-native workloads
* AI-driven ecosystems

---

##   Vision

The goal of this template is simple:

> **Give teams and architects a strong, opinionated foundation to build enterprise-grade applications that are scalable, maintainable, AI-ready and cloud-native from day one.**

This project captures over **20 years of experience** across cloud architecture, enterprise software engineering, and large-scale distributed systems.

It reflects the evolution from “software that scales” to **“software that reasons.”**

---

##   Key Capabilities

### Enterprise-Ready Architecture

A modular, decoupled structure aligned with modern architectural principles.

### AI Integration Layer

Plug-and-play support for:

* Azure OpenAI
* Prompt Orchestration
* Semantic Search
* Vector Databases
* Domain-specific LLM patterns

### Clean Architecture & Vertical Slices

Clear separation of concerns and feature-based composition.

### ADR — Architecture Decision Records

Documented architectural reasoning, as expected in mature engineering organizations.

### C4 Model Documentation

System Context → Container → Component → Code.

### Wiki-Ready Documentation

Optimized for:

* GitHub Wiki
* Azure DevOps *Publish Code as Wiki*
* Markdown-first architectures

### DevOps-Friendly

CI/CD pipelines for modern build & test workflows.

---

##   Architecture (C4)

### **Level 1 — System Context**

Defines core actors, boundaries, and integration points.

### **Level 2 — Container View**

Breaks down the application into API, Application Layer, Domain, Infrastructure, and AI Components.

### **Level 3 — Component View**

Detailed breakdown of modules and responsibilities.

### **Level 4 — Code View**

Vertical slices, handlers, pipelines, validators, repositories.

> Full diagrams are available in `/wiki/architecture/`.

##   AI-First Architecture

This template includes an **AI Integration Layer** designed to support:

* Hybrid reasoning (rules + LLMs)
* Document intelligence
* Semantic enrichment
* Retrieval-Augmented Generation
* Intelligent workflows
* Domain-driven LLM patterns

AI is not treated as an “add-on”,
but as a **first-class architectural citizen**.

---

##   Documentation-as-Code

The repository includes a complete documentation structure under `/wiki`, ready to be published as a **GitHub Wiki** or **Azure DevOps Wiki**, featuring:

* Architecture Overview
* ADRs
* C4 Model
* DevOps Pipeline
* AI Governance
* How-to Guides

This enables *architectural continuity* across teams.

---

##   Use Cases

This template is ideal for:

* Enterprise applications
* Microservice ecosystems
* AI Document Processing Systems
* Public Administration & Healthcare
* Energy & Manufacturing
* Event-driven architectures
* Modular cloud-native platforms

---

##   Global Recognition

This project has already attracted attention from
**architects, engineers and AI practitioners across Europe and North America**,
thanks to its clear structure and enterprise-oriented design.

Its AI-first approach and architectural consistency make it a valuable reference for teams working on modern cloud-native applications.
