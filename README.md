# .NET Enterprise Architecture Template  
### Clean Architecture • CQRS • Mediator • DDD • .NET 8 • Serilog • EF Core • OpenTelemetry

A production-ready **.NET 8 enterprise template** that implements modern architectural best practices  
for building scalable, maintainable, testable and cloud-ready applications.

This template is designed for **enterprise systems**, **microservices**, **API backends**,  
and **modular domains**.  
It serves as a strong foundation for real-world projects and as a reference implementation for teams.

# 🚀 Purpose

This template provides:
- A **real Clean Architecture implementation**
- A complete **CQRS + Mediator** pipeline
- A **Domain-Driven Design** structure (Entities, Value Objects, Domain Events)
- A consistent **vertical slice architecture**
- Enterprise-grade **logging, telemetry, error handling**
- Well-organized **API endpoints**
- Ready-to-use **DI, configuration, validation**
- **EF Core + Dapper hybrid** data access
- Cloud-friendly structure (Azure, AWS, containers)
